# Take-Back
A low poly RPG. Emphasis is on letting the player figure out the adventure. It will be possible to fail.

After the initial journey is complete players will have the option to pursue 3 different types of gameplay:
<ul>
<li>Explorer - Player will explore their home world to find more secrets/adventures</li>
<li>Guardian - Player will travel to other worlds fighting the Raza there(This will have the potential for MMO aspects and procedurally generated worlds)</li>
<li>Builder - Player will be able to do world building tasks to make a home in a new area of Fimedia/Fimian.</li>
</ul>

These types of gameplay will be implemented only once the main adventure is finished.
The current plan is to implement the Gaurdian path first, followed by Explorer, then Builder.
